## Current Situation

In 2024, there are an estimated 76.4 million freelancers in the U.S., accounting for approximately 36% of the U.S. workforce. However, outdated freelancing systems lead to poor matches, wasted hiring time, and unprotected freelancers facing wage theft.

While there are new platforms focusing on elite recruitment or open hiring, they still sell access to people. PivotHire is different: **we provide a fully managed, project-delivery service that sells guaranteed outcomes.**
