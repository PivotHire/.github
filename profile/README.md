## Current Situation

In 2024, there are an estimated 76.4 million freelancers in the U.S., accounting for **approximately 36%** of the U.S. workforce.

However, outdated freelancing systems lead to poor matches, wasted hiring time, confidentiality issues, and unprotected freelancers facing wage theft.

Low efficiency. Low trust. Low sustainability. Current freelancing patterns will eventually fail under its own weight.
